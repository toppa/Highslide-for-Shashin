_Highslide for Shashin_ allows you to use Highslide with the Shashin plugin for WordPress.

Description
-----------

**Installation of [Shashin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shashin/) is required. Please download and activate it before installing _Highslide for Shashin_.**

_Highslide for Shashin_ installs as its own plugin. After you install it, "Highslide" will be available as a viewer option on the Shashin settings page. It also has its own settings page for Highslide's settings.

This plugin has a split license:

* All files in the directory shashin/Public/Display/highslide fall under [these license terms](http://www.highslide.com/#license). **It is important to note that Highslide is free for non-commercial use only.** Please follow the license terms link for further information.
* All other files are GPLv2
* Based on this entry in the GPL FAQ, it is my understanding that distributing this plugin under a split license is valid under the terms of GPLv2, as Shashin can be configured to work with other viewers.
